## Providing feedback on this specification

The OSCAL team welcomes feedback on the work in progress in this subdirectory, whether it be questions, points for clarification, critiques or suggestions. A rendered version of the Profile Resolution specification maintained here appears on the OSCAL web site, at location https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/processing/profile-resolution/.

Please post Issues in Github or questions to the OSCAL mailing list, or ask about them on our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/usnistgov-OSCAL/Lobby). (See https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/contact/ for links.)

The specifications are being edited in an ad-hoc XML back end format, a lightweight extension to HTML tagging. If you wish to edit the files directly, we have stylesheets for presentation and HTML conversion along with Schematron for validation (runtime or at check points); please contact us.
