When necessary, revision history can be also documented. See additional information [here](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/catalog/xml-model-map/)

The `metadata` is also designed to accommodate the representation of other information related to the content of the catalog and the entity (individual or organization) that created it in OSCAL. 
For example, we can select and represent *keywords* using the property tag `<prop></prop>`, for which we define the `name` of the property as being *keywords*. 
The *keywords* will be a `string` comprised of a comma-separated list of significant words, in alphabetical order.

The information will look as follows:
```xml
       <prop name="keywords">Assurance, computer security, FISMA, Privacy Act, Risk Management Framework, security controls, security requirements</prop>
```

To do so, one can use the tags `<role></role`> and `<party></party>` each instance with a distinct `id`, and the tag `<responsible-party></responsible-party>` with the field `role-id` that identifies the id of the pointed role and the tag `<party-id></party-id>` that points to the `id` of the defined `<party>`.
In this example the `<party>` is an organization (NIST) for which the name is provided using the tag `<org-name></org-name>`, an email address is listed using the tag `<email></email>` and the URL using the tag `<url>`. 
Below is all this information assembled in OSCAL.

```xml
      <role id="creator">
         <title>Document creator</title>
      </role>
      <role id="contact">
         <title>Contact</title>
      </role>
      <party id="NIST">
         <org>
            <org-name>National Institute of Standards and Technology</org-name>
            <email>oscal@nist.gov</email>
            <url>https://www.nist.gov/oscal</url>
         </org>
      </party>
      <responsible-party role-id="creator">
         <party-id>NIST</party-id>
      </responsible-party>
      <responsible-party role-id="contact">
         <party-id>NIST</party-id>
      </responsible-party>
```

#### Formatting a Back-matter

Often documents have references, links to other documents, diagrams/images, citations, remarks. 
OSCAL defines elements that can be used to represent such information.

Back-matters are optional elements and therefore often the OSCAL Catalogs will not contain any.

A back-matter element is identified by the tag `<back-matter></back-matter>`. 
This element may have `resources` which are identified with the tag `<resources></resources>`.     

Each `resource` may have:

```
    * `title` identified by the tags <title></title>
    * `description` identified by the tags <desc></desc>
    * `property` identified by the tags <prop></prop>
    * `document id` identified by the tags <doc-id></doc-id>
    * `citation` identified by the tags <citation></citation>
    * `link` identified by the tags <rlink></rlink>
    * `base64-binary-data` identified by the tags <base64></base64>
    * `remarks` identified by the tags <remarks></remarks>
```
Our catalog does not contain any back-matter, but additional information about the available 
elements and their fields, can be found [here](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/catalog/xml-model-map/)
