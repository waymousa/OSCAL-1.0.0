The OSCAL catalog layer provides a structured catalog model for representing a **catalog** of **controls**.

## Layer Organization

The OSCAL [catalog model](catalog/) provides a structured, machine-readable XML, JSON, and YAML representations of the information contained within a control catalog. It is important to note that the OSCAL catalog model is not a catalog document format. This means that the introductory prose included in many control catalogs is not present in the OSCAL catalog model. Instead, the OSCAL catalog formats provide a robust syntax for representing collections of controls, including control statements, assessment objectives, and other control details. This structured form of a control catalog allows control information to be easily imported, exported, indexed, and searched by applications.

The OSCAL catalog model is the sole model in the OSCAL catalog layer of the OSCAL architecture.
