## Purpose

The OSCAL Assessment Results model defines the information contained within an assessment report supporting assessment and continuous monitoring capabilities.

## Authors and Consumers

### Assessment Results Authors

{{<callout>}}Assessors, Continuous Assessment Tools{{</callout>}}

Assessors develop the assessment results to report what was assessed, how it was assessed, who performed the assessment, what was found, and what risks were identified.

### Assessment Results Consumers

{{<callout>}}System Owners, Authorizing Officials, Continuous Assessment Monitoring Practitioners{{</callout>}}

System owners consume the assessment results to understand the risk posture of their system, as well as to target risks for remediation and plan risk remediation activities.

Authorizing officials consume assessment results in the adjudication of a system as part of approving an authorization to operate.

Continuous assessment monitoring practitioners consume the assessment results as part of monitoring the system's security posture.

##  Assessment Results Organization

An OSCAL profile is organized as follows:
- **Metadata**: Metadata syntax is identical and required in all OSCAL models. It includes information such as the file's title, publication version, publication date, and OSCAL version. Metadata is also used to define roles, parties (people, teams and organizations), and locations.
- **Import AP**: Identifies the OSCAL-based assessment plan (AP) for this assessment. The AP imports several pieces of information about the system being assessed including the system security plan (SSP), which is also represented according to the OSCAL [SSP model](../../implementation-layer/ssp/). This linking of data eliminates the need to duplicate and maintain the same information in multiple places.
- **Objectives**: : Identifies the controls to be included within the scope of this assessment, as well as the control objectives and assessment methods.
- **Assessment Subject**: Identifies the in-scope elements of the system, including locations, components, inventory items, and users.
- **Assessment Assets**: Identifies the assessor's assets used to perform the assessment, including the team, tool, and rules of engagement content.
- **Assessment Activities**: Describes the schedule, manual and automated tests, and other activities that may be explicitly be allowed or prohibited. 
- **Results**: Describes the assessment findings, identified risks, and recommended remediation. Also identifies false positive results, risk adjustments, and operationally required risks, as well as when the results should expire.
- **Back Matter**: Back matter syntax is identical in all OSCAL models. It is used for attachments, citations, and embedded content such as graphics.

## Key Concepts

The OSCAL Assessment Results model is part of the [OSCAL Assessment Results Layer](../). It defines structured, machine-readable XML, JSON, and YAML representations of the information contained within an assessment report.

This model is typically used by anyone performing assessment or continuous monitoring activities on a system to determine the degree to which that system complies with one or more frameworks.

This model allows an assessor to express all details associated with a classic "snapshot in time" assessment, including the scope of the assessment, times and dates of activities, actual assessment activities performed, as well as any observations, findings, and identified risks. It also allows organizations to report continuous assessment information. 

OSCAL assessment results are always defined in the context of an assessment plan, and must always be associated with an OSCAL [Assessment Plan (AP)](../../assessment-layer/assessment-plan/). OSCAL assessment results are associated with a specific system via the OSCAL assessment plan, which identifies the system to be assessed.

The current version of this model was created based on the information requirements of a [FedRAMP Security Assessment Report](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Annual-SAR-Template.docx), and was expanded to include continuous assessment capabilities. 

This model was designed to use identical syntax to the [assessment plan model](../../assessment-layer/assessment-plan/), for overlapping syntax (Objectives, Assessment Subject, Assets, and Assessment Activities). It was also designed to use identical syntax to the [Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)](../poam/), for Results/Risks.
