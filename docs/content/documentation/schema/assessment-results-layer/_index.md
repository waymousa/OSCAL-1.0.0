The OSCAL assessment results layer provides models for describing or reporting the results of assessment activities.

The OSCAL models comprising the assessment layer are:

1. An **[Assessment Results model](assessment-results/)**, which represents the __findings__ of a periodic or continuous assessment of a specific system.

1. A **[Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) model](poam/)**, which represents the known risks for a specific system, as well as the identified deviations, remediation plan, and disposition status of each risk.

1. Possible additional assessment results models to be defined and developed as part of [OSCAL 2.0](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/milestones). 

The assessment results and POA&M models are designed to enable easy flow of risk information from the results to the POA&M. These models are intended to be used in the context of a specific system. The assessment results are further intended to be used in the context of a specific assessment plan.

The OSCAL assessment results layer is part of the OSCAL [architecture](/learnmore/architecture/).
